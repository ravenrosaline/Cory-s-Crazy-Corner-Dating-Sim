This is a spoof game.
The goal of this game is to teach others how to use github and Unity to colab
as well as teaching others, who are beginning and are interested in creating 
videogames, to use C#. Since Unity can use colaborate with Visual Studio, we will be using that too.

This game is not meant for those to be easliy offended.
So, if you decide to play it and get offended, it's not our fault.
We told you 💁
